Abilities and Bonus:

Every card has both an ability and a bonus printed on them.
Each card has its own ability, although some cards share the same one.
Cards can have "No ability" printed on the card.
The ability is unlocked at a designed level. Until the card reaches that level, it has no ability.
Both abilities and bonus apply only for the round the card is played.

Code:

Ability and Bonus have no difference on behaviour, so in the code both are a Skill.
A Skill is defined by zero/one/two prefixes, one suffix, and can have up to two numerical values.
The first number (X) represents the amount. The second number (Y) represents the limit (max/min/out of...)

Bonus:

Every card belongs to a clan.
Cards from the same clan share the same bonus.
A card has its bonus unlocked if there is another card on the same hand from the same clan but different name.

Suffix:
A skill can affect the round broadly in two ways: 
- It can modify the round's conditions before it resolves (increase power, cancel a bonus...)
- Or can apply an effect after a round is resolved (apply poison, recover some pillz...)
The skill effect is defined by it's suffix.

Prefix:
A skill's condition to activate can be modified by its prefix.
Some prefixes apply a conditional multiplier.

Leaders:

There is a special clan called Leaders. This clan's abilities and bonus behaves differently.
A leader ability is active for the entire combat, regardless that the card is played or not.
The Leaders bonus is "Cancel Leader": 
If a player draws more than one leader, all of their leader's cards lose their ability.
