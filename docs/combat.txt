General card's description:

Each card has 3 numeric values: level, power and damage.
Level represents the general strength of the card (from 1 to 5)
More level means more power and damage, and sometimes having its ability unlocked.
Power represents how easy is to win a round with the card.
Damage is applied to the enemy if round is won.
Cards are known to have power and damage values from 1 to 9, but there is no upper limit.

Combat's flow:

A combat consists on one player versus other.
It begins with each player drawing 4 cards from their deck.
Each player begins with 12 lives and 12 pillz.
On first round, initiative is set randomly to one player. 
Each round initiative is switched.
Cards in hand are public and faceup for the whole combat.
A combat finishes after 4 rounds, or a KO is declared, whatever happens first.
Each card can only be played once per combat.

Round's flow:

The player with initiative choses one card from its hand to be played.
The selection is made public, and then the other player does the same.

Now pillz are expended, and this decision is secret until round resolves.
Each player expends any amount (zero if desired) of pillz to increase the card's attack.
Is possible to expend exactly 3 additional pillz to apply fury to the card.
A card with fury has +2 damage.

After both players confirm pillz consumption, round resolves.
Each players attack is calculated like this:
CardPower * (1 + UsedPillz)
Fury's pillz (if apply) are not considered on this formula.
The card with the greater attack wins the round.
If attack is equal, the card with the lesser level wins.
If level is equal, the player with initiative wins.
The round's loser loses as many lives as the damage of their opponent card.

If a player gets to zero lives, is KO'ed and loses the combat.
Otherwise, another round is played.
After 4 founds are played, the player with more lives wins the combat.
If both players have the same amount of lives, the combat ends in a draw.
