Reasons for having commented code
---------------------------------

Before UrbanRivalsApiManager build 151221a, the ApiCall Urc.GetCharacters was not available, so the procedure to check for new existing cards was as follows:
A) Check what new cards we need to download
B) Download those cards and update the DB

Step (A) worked like this:
a) Identify what cards we currenly have on our DB
b) Identify all existing cards on the game
c) Intersect both lists, getting only existing cards

Step (b) has to be done in a concrete way because:
- Each card has an unique numerical Id
- There are cards that were removed at one point in the game
So:
- We need to detect what cards exist and what not
- That is done checking EVERY Id from the beginning, until an arbitrary max value is reached

And for these reasons, step (b) works like this:
1) Set a maximum id so the code is not checking until "infinity" 
2) Set a minimum id so the code can skip several iterations of unused Ids
3) Check each Id between minimum and maximum and return only those that the server ensures that exist

Step (3) needed around 1500 calls to the API, which in practice wasted around 5 minutes of the application frozen with I/O.

With Urc.GetCharacters we can do step (3) in a simple call, so we must edit all that code.

What to do with that commented code
-----------------------------------

I'll keep the old code in case the ApiCall is removed. 
I'll assume the call is safe to use and will not be removed if 6 months have passed and the call remains available.

Today is 22/12/2015

Commented code (and therefore this file too) will be safe to be removed on 22/06/2016
