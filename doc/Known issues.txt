Gameplay
- When a player with "Backlash: Poison" wins a player with "Defeat: Poison". The right player poison will be aplied, no matter who has what card. The UR staff said that in that specific case, both poisons would stack
- When applying "Stop Opp Life Modifier" it will stop enemy Heal and own Poison, regardless who applied it (for example with Backlash)
